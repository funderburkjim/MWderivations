Derivations of headwords in the Monier-Williams (1899) dictionary

This Sanskrit dictionary was developed by Monier-Williams to make obvious many
of the interrelations of Sanskrit words.  The author discusses this in his 
preface to the dictionary, particularly in [Section II](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/csldoc/dictionaries/prefaces/mwpref/mwpref11.html).


The markup of the Cologne digitization of the dictionary recognizes this 4-level system and thus
makes feasible computer-assisted investigations of this system.  The *list* displays  (for instance,
[here](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc1/index.php) and
[here](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/awork/apidev/sample/list-0.2.html) ) show the
primary relations.

The current repository should be viewed as one such investigation.  In particular, it aims to
provide a systematic identification of the derivation of the substantives (nouns, adjectives, indeclineables).
This identification makes use of the 4-level system as much as possible.

There are readme files in the various sub-directories which describe the methodological and procedural
details of the computations, as well as the data sources. 

Feb 9, 2016.  The main output to look at is step3/analysis2.txt
  There remain about 9000 records without derivation (approx. 5%).
  Many of these will be resolved by an external source of 'kta' forms of
  roots and of gerunds of roots.
step2/analysis.txt is an earlier version.  It left about 30,000 (15%) of
  records without derivation.
